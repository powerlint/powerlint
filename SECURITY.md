## Responsible disclosure security policy

A responsible disclosure policy helps protect our users from publicly disclosed
security vulnerabilities without a fix by employing a process where
vulnerabilities are first triaged in a private manner and only publicly
disclosed after a reasonable period that allows patching the vulnerability and
providing an upgrade path for users.

When contacting us directly, we will do our best to respond reasonably to
resolve the issue.

Please refrain from malicious acts that put our users, any contributors, or the
project itself at risk.

## Reporting a vulnerability

We consider the security of our packages and libraries a top priority. But no
matter how much effort we put into system security, vulnerabilities can still be
present.

**If you discover a security vulnerability, please report the issue through our
repository's [security advisories page][advisories]. Do not use public
communication methods (such as IRC, Discord, or GitHub issues/discussions).**

Your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings are sincerely appreciated and
will be taken into account to acknowledge your contributions.
