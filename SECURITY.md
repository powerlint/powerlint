## Responsible disclosure security policy

A responsible disclosure policy helps protect our users from publicly disclosed security vulnerabilities without a fix by employing a process where vulnerabilities are first triaged in a private manner and only publicly disclosed after a reasonable period that allows patching the vulnerability and providing an upgrade path for users.

When contacting us directly, we will do our best to respond reasonably to resolve the issue.

Please refrain from malicious acts that put our users, any contributors, or the project itself at risk.

## Reporting a vulnerability

We consider the security of our packages and libraries a top priority. But no matter how much effort we put into system security, vulnerabilities can still be present.

**If you discover a security vulnerability, please report the issue through our repository's [security advisories page][advisories]. Do not use public communication methods (such as IRC, Discord, or GitHub issues/discussions).**

Your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings are sincerely appreciated and will be taken into account to acknowledge your contributions.
